# Details of my SOC:

We completed our SOC project through 4 "weekly" assignments. We were given more than a week's time for each so that we also got time to learn the concepts required for that weeks sums before attempting them.


Each week's set, contained about 10 questions based on topics which we were informed about a few days back. After we had finished learning the related concepts through resources/books provided by our mentors, we took to solve the questions, which often took a lot of time/days and tries due to their complexity.

We submitted the sums on their respective codeforces links, so that we could test them against a lot of testcases for accuracy and time complexity.
